# Railway_Reservation_system

**Introduction:**
The Railway Reservation System is a multi-user application designed to facilitate the booking of train tickets. This project focuses on the database part, including schema design, stored procedures, and triggers, along with the implementation of the back-end using a high-level language (Java) for accessing the database. The system allows multiple agents to access the booking function concurrently and assumes that each ticket is booked for the entire journey of the train. Additionally, it is assumed that all trains run on all days.
